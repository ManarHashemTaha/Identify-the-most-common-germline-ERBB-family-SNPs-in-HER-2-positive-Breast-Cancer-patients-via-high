Breast cancer (BC) is  the most common malignancy in women with over 25% of all cancers being diagnosed as BC in 2018. HER2-positive BC  accounts for around 20% of all human BCs and  HER2 overexpression is associated with poor prognosis and an aggressive phenotype. Trastuzumab is a monoclonal antibody targeted to HER2, has well established efficacy in the treatment of HER2-positive BC. However, a significant proportion of patients with the disease have tumors that initially do not respond or that acquire resistance to trastuzumab after an initial period of response . ERBB-family genes which encode the HER family of proteins EGFR, HER2, HER3 and HER4 are commonly studied in HER2-positive BC, and some studies have identified the role of HER2 SNPs in response to trastuzumab .Here we want to identify the most common germline ERBB-family SNPs in HER-2 positive BC patients by via high depth NGS
